    "## 1. General description\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real transmission and/or reflection microscope, objects are imaged using a combination of lighting systems and lenses. The path of light in such microscopes can always be decomposed in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Light propagates from the illuminating source to the object through the illumination optical setup.\n",
    "2. Light is transmitted through (or reflected from) the object.\n",
    "3. Light transmitted or reflected from the object propagates through the microscope objective and form an observable image in a target plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case of spectrally-extended lighting (e.g. white light lamp) can be easily covered by summing-by-intensity the final images formed by the different wavelengths of the lamp spectrum (in Nemaktis, this is done internally after repeating the imaging simulations for all the wavelengths in a user-defined array approximating the lamp spectrum). Here, we consider for simplicity's sake a simple microscopy model based on lighting with a single wavelength. We describe below the physical mechanisms behind the three steps introduced above. "

    "## 2. Koehler illumination setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The first propagation step is the illumination of the object by the light source. The standard illumination setup used in most microscopes is called the Koehler illumination setup (introduced by August Koehler in 1893), and has the advantage of allowing a uniform lighting even with non-uniform light source. In short, it allows to map each point of the light source to a single uniform plane wave incident on the object with a certain angle; the maximum angle of incidence for the plane waves is set by an aperture called the **condenser aperture**, thus the set of plane waves incident on the object all have wavevectors included inside a cone of illumination whose opening is set by the condenser aperture. In addition, a **field aperture** allows to control the size of the lighting spot on the object, but this feature is irrelevant in Nemaktis since we always assume that the whole computational box representing the object is illuminated.\n",

The transmission and reflection of light in such objects is modeled by the well-known wave equation for the time-harmonic Maxwell electric field $\\vec{E}(x,y,z)\\exp\\left[-ik_0ct\\right]$ (with $c$ the light speed and $k_0$ the wavevector in empty space):\n",

This generalized framework relies on a minimal set of physical assumptions (most notably a relatively small refractive index contrast $\\Delta n<0.4$ inside the object) and admits two Beam Propagation Methods (BPM):\n",

    "- Paraxial BPM, which can accurately propagate optical fields up to deviation angles of 5-10Â°. \n",

    "The second version of BPM is especially suite for microscopy applications, since in most microscopes (exluding confocal microscopes with high numerical aperture objective) only the paraxial components of light contributes to the final image. In our open-source package Nemaktis, only paraxial BPM is included as a backend for microscopy, but we are open to new collaborations on our closed-source wide-angle BPM for advanced use (nonlinear optics, modeling of complex photonics devices, steering of light using birefringent structures...).\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"images/layers.svg\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The permittivity tensor is assumed to be stepwise constant along $z$ (the main axis of propagation inside the microscope) but is allowed to have arbitrary variations in the transverse directions $x$ and $y$. Our beam propagation framework correspond to a set of equations allowing to propagate the optical fields inside each layers (including diffraction and beam walk-off effects due to the nonuniformity of the optical and permittivity fields) and transfer fields through the discontinuity interface between each layer. In Nemaktis, we assume smooth variations of the permittivity along $z$ and therefore only propagates forward-propagating fields using the following formula:\n",

    "$$\\mathbf{E}(z_{n+1})=\\mathbf{U}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}(z_n),$$\n",

The evolution operator $\\mathbf{U}$ is directly derived from Maxwell equations with a few mathematical assumptions (small index contrast and paraxiality of fields) and can be applied in a very efficient way (complexity $O(N)$, with $N$ the total number of degree-of-freedoms for the computational mesh).\n",

    "Since we only take into account forward-propagating fields, reflection microscopy is currently not supported in Nemaktis, but we hope to implement this feature in the future since we already derived the associated theoretical framework. Note that internally, each imaging simulation includes a lot of different paraxial BPM sub-simulation for each incident plane-wave, source wavelength, and input polarisations. Using the same notation as in Sec.&nbsp;2 and assuming a single input wavelength, the incident optical fields for all these sub-simulations are written as:\n",

    "### 3.2 The diffraction transfer matrix backend (dtmm)\n",
    "\n",
    "This backend correspond to a python package originally written by a colleague, Dr. Andrej Petelin, and that we decided to include in Nemaktis for easy comparison between different approaches of electromagnetic field propagation. At its core, the diffractive transfer matrix method (DTMM) of Dr. Petelin is conceptually very close to the beam propagation backend presented above in Sec.&nbsp;3.1: the permittivity tensor field representing the object is also split in a series of birefringent slabs, evolution operators are similarly used to propagate the fields inside the slabs, and continuity equations are used to transfer the fields between the layers. The difference between DTMM and our BPM framework mainly lie in the way that the evolution operators are calculated: in DTMM, this evolution operator is calculated with a clever heuristic combination of the Berreman method and diffraction transfer matrix applied in Fourier space. The Berreman method was originally developped for the calculation of transmitted and reflected light in layered system (permittivity tensor field independent from $x$ and $y$) and neglects diffraction (the redistribution of optical energy due to non-uniformity of the optical and permittivity fields); in DTMM, the evolution operators derived by Berreman are combined with a powerful treatment of diffraction in Fourier space based on local mode grouping, thus allowing to take into account variations of fields in the $x$ and $y$ directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a Fourier-based method, its complexity is $O(N\\log\\left[N/N_z\\right])$ with $N$ the total number of mesh points and $N_z$ the number of layers. It is also based on a user-defined parameter allowing to define the accuracy of diffraction in the simulation: low value of this parameter provide quick (but inacurate) simulations with faster running times than BPM on relatively small meshes (for big meshes, the logarithmic complexity of dtmm kicks in and DTMM is slower than BPM), whereas high value provide accurate simulations (computational errors slightly worse than the ones obtained with BPM, but still relatively good) with slower running times than with BPM. \n",
    "In short, DTMM is the perfect backend if you want to quickly try imaging simulations without worrying too much about the accuracy, whereas BPM is more suited for efficient accurate simulations on arbitrary big meshes (provided that enough random-access-memory is available!).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Nemaktis, DTMM is closely integrated in the high-level python package allowing to run imaging simulations, but we emphasize that DTMM also has a dedicated python package with advanced features such as iterative algorithms for the calculation of reflected fields (a feature which is currently missing in the BPM backend):\n",

As a general rule, this system is always associated with two planes:\n",

In Nemaktis, we use a very simple model of imaging system based on a single objective lens and the imaging/focusing planes placed at distance $2f$ on each side of the lens (with $f$ the focal length of the objective). We assume that the objective is an ideal thin-lens, which allows us to obtain a very simple form of the linear transform above in the transverse Fourier space (see details in [J. W. Goodman, *Introduction to Fourier optics*, Roberts & Company Publishers (2005)]):\n",
